Geographic coverage is the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Values include energy service provider (power marketer) data.
Values for 2020 and prior years are final. Values for 2022 and 2021 are preliminary estimates based on a cutoff model sample. See Technical Notes for a discussion of the sample design for the Form EIA-826. Utilities and energy service providers may classify commercial and industrial customers based on either NAICS codes or demands or usage falling within specified limits by rate schedule. Changes from year to year in consumer counts, sales and revenues, particularly involving the commercial and industrial consumer sectors, may result from respondent implementation of changes in the definitions of consumers, and reclassifications. Sales and net generation may not correspond exactly for a particular month for a variety of reasons (i.e., sales data may include purchases of electricity from nonutilities or imported electricity). Net generation is for the calendar month while sales and associated revenue accumulate from bills collected for periods of time (28 to 35 days) that vary dependent upon customer class and consumption occurring in and outside the calendar month.
